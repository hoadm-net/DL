# Concept: Practical Regularization Toolbox

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Combine multiple techniques to build robust training pipelines.

---

## ðŸ“‹ Checklist and patterns
- Data augmentation (domain-specific)
- Early stopping by validation loss/metric
- L2/weight decay on weights (not on biases/BatchNorm by default)
- Dropout (tuned per layer)
- Learning rate schedules (reduce-on-plateau)
- Proper initialization and normalization (BatchNorm/LayerNorm)
- Model capacity control (width/depth)
- Cross-validation and proper splits

---

## ðŸ§  Strategy
- Start simple: baseline with minimal regularization
- Add one technique at a time; measure effect
- Prefer data-centric methods first (augmentation)
- Monitor training/validation curves and calibration

---

## âœ… Success criteria
- You can propose and justify a regularization plan for a task
- You can explain trade-offs among techniques
- You can design ablations to measure impact
