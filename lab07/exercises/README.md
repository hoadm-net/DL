# Lab 07 Exercises (Concepts-only repo)

Implement exercises in your own environment; no code files are kept here.

Suggested tasks:
- Build a data pipeline for MNIST or CIFAR-10 with stratified train/val/test splits.
- Compute normalization statistics on training only and apply to val/test.
- Implement metrics: accuracy, per-class precision/recall, macro/micro F1, ROC-AUC.
- Run 3–5 seeded runs with early stopping; report mean ± std.
